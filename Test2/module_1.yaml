  template: "# Cybersecurity Champion Charter\r\n\r\nThe Product Cybersecurity Champions
    will be responsible for creating and maintaining the cybersecurity artifacts necessary
    for the successful implementation of the Secure Product Development Framework
    for the Orion Project. They will work closely with other members of the development
    team to ensure that cybersecurity considerations are integrated into every aspect
    of product design and development.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their artifact creation
    and maintenance responsibilities, the Product Cybersecurity Champions will also
    be responsible for facilitating the execution of the required cybersecurity activities
    outlined in the Secure Product Development Framework. This includes identifying
    potential security threats and vulnerabilities, developing, and implementing appropriate
    countermeasures, and ensuring that all cybersecurity policies and procedures are
    followed.\r\n\r\nThe Product Cybersecurity Champions will serve as the primary
    point of contact for all cybersecurity-related issues and concerns within the
    product development team. They will work closely with other teams, including quality
    assurance and compliance, to ensure that all security requirements are met and
    that our products are developed with the highest possible level of security.\r\n\r\n
